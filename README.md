# Welcome to Chatty.

### Reason:

- I just have a lot of free times and want to talk with somebody without going through a lot security layer such login and 2-factor auth. I want to create something that everyone can quickly connect and become "chatty".

### How to run:

- Simple backend no database, just run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` in chattybackend folder. for the frontend, use any of your favorite node package mangers to install and then `run dev`.
